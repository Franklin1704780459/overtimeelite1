    <p class="title">Welcome to the official Overtime Elite Website</p>
    <p>
      Five years ago, Overtime set out
      to build a different kind of sports community and brand to serve the next
      generation of fans. The secret to our success was an early insight that
      the next generation of all-star athletes was fundamentally different.
      Social media had completely changed the game. But sports media hadn't
      caught up. We built Overtime's fan base by covering those athletes
      differently from legacy sports media and right away, the approach
      resonated with both fans and the athletes themselves. Today, our
      programming is viewed more than 18 billion times a year and we built a
      community of more than 50 million followers across all our platforms. We
      have developed extremely close relationships with players and their
      families, which has given us an intimate understanding of their journey,
      as well as their struggles. We've also heard about cracks in today's
      system, and the stress it's putting on their bodies, their families and
      their finances. 2019 was an enlightening year for Overtime, where our eyes
      were opened to the flaws in the system. In May, we held a weekend-long
      event, the Overtime Takeover, where we hosted many of the country's top
      basketball players (and their families). Over the course of the weekend,
      we had a series of conversations with them where it became clear that the
      system was broken. At the same time, we noticed that more and more top
      players were bucking the traditional path. They were changing schools,
      playing internationally, skipping college and training at home. The
      traditional path either doesn't work or isn't appealing for these players,
      so they're charting a new course. That summer we began in-depth
      discussions with top prospects and their parents. We wanted to better
      understand what was happening and why. We came away with three big
      conclusions about what's missing for players in today's basketball
      ecosystem. Player Development: Lack of access to the best training,
      coaching and facilities Education: Academics are not prioritized and
      applicable professional skills training is ignored Economic Empowerment:
      Players are restricted from realizing their market value The more we
      learned, the more we asked: how can we help fix this?
