Players receive a minimum salary of $100,000 annually, a signing bonus, and shares in Overtime's larger business. Players can also choose a scholarship option and maintain college eligibility. According to the New York Times, Overtime "provides health and disability insurance and sets aside $100,000 in college scholarship money for each player if they decide not to pursue professional basketball afterwards".[2][3]
    Athletes participate in an academic program featuring a 4:1 student-teacher ratio and a curriculum offering traditional high school subjects alongside life skill-related subjects in financial literacy, social media and other media training, and mental health and wellness.[4]

Cunningham became the first Overtime Elite player to forgo being paid a salary, preserving college basketball eligibility after graduating from high school.[13] In July that year, Pau Gasol joined Carmelo Anthony and Jay Williams on the Overtime Elite board of directors.[14] In September, Damien Wilkins was named general manager and Head of Basketball.[15] In October, Overtime Elite announced a partnership with GMC.[16] In November, Overtime Elite and Amazon Prime Video agreed to a multi-year global distribution partnership to stream 20 live Overtime Elite games per season for the league's next three seasons alongside the launch of a series on Overtime Elite in 2023.[17]
    In October 2023, Overtime Elite agreed to a multi-year partnership for Adidas to become the league’s exclusive apparel and footwear sponsor.[18] In February 2024, Adidas basketball announced they expanded their NIL roster by signing Overtime Elite players in Ian Jackson, Karter Knox, Mikel Brown Jr., and Adam Oumiddoch.[19]
